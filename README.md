### Rancid Tomatillos

#### Abstract
This is a group project completed during Mod 3 at Turing School of Software and Design. The project asked us to complete a movie-rating site using Redux and React where a user can browse and rate movies. The user logs in with credentials (username: lucy@turing.io, password: password1) which are checked against data fetched from an API of users. Once logged in, the user can browse through movies displayed on the dashboard, click to view more details about a movie, and rate movies. The user can delete their existing rating and re-rate a given movie. The user is also provided with the average rating for each movie, calculated using data fetched from an API.

If a user is not logged in, they can still view movies and the average ratings for each movie. The form to rate a movie is not displayed, nor is the text displaying their rating (or a message saying they have not rated the movie yet).

#### Wireframe
The wireframe we developed for this project can be viewed on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/DqY5IU1HjxJkvv1UEd7mPT/Rancid-Tomatillos?node-id=0%3A1).

#### Project Next Steps
We would like to refactor our conditionals with fetch to use try/catch blocks (instead of checking the ok status and basing actions off of that). This will also require a refactoring of our tests, but would allow us to increase the span and depth of our testing, especially when mocking fetch calls.
